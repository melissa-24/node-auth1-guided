// the two new modules for this topic... express-session basically manages
// session data in a store of some kind, and manages the processing of inbound
// cookies, and outbound cookies, related to the session.
// 
// Remember that session data can be stored in memory, or in a database. A
// "memcache" system is basically an exotic database that is stored in memory
// chips on a remote server. It has the performance of memory, with the
// persistence of a database on magnetic media (like a disk drive array or a
// SAN, etc.) The point is that session data is stored so that when future
// requests come in with a cookie that has a session ID in it, the "session
// manager" (software that manages the creation, access to, and maintenance of
// session data) can find the session data and make it available. 
// 
// The express-session session manager automatically creates a "req.session"
// object for every inbound request. If the inbound request includes a cookie
// that matches the "name" parameter of the express-session middleware (see
// sessionOptions below), then express-session will look in its store (depending
// on how it's configured... we have it configured to use a database through
// knex) and try to find a session that has the session id ("sid") in the store.
// If it does find one, and it's not expired (also a configuration option in
// sessionOptions below), then it will take any additional data stored with the
// session record in the store and add it to the req.session object. 
//
// connect-session-knex is a module that allows express-session to use knex to
// store session/cookie data. However knex is configured (whether to use
// sqlite3, mysql, mssql, oracle, postgres, etc.) is where the actual session
// data is stored. express-session is configured to use a new instance of
// connect-session-knex as its store. See the require() below for more notes. 
// 
// Note that all cookies contain is the session identifier. When the server
// (through express-session) creates a session record, a session ID is assigned.
// The server then sends in the response a "set-cookie" header, with the value
// containing nothing but an encrypted version of the session ID. 
// 
// When the browser receives the response, and sees the "set-cookie" header, it
// will create a cookie in its local cookie database. Part of that cookie
// includes the domain name or URL that the cookie is meant for. The browser
// knows that on every request it sends to a server at that url, it should
// create a header called "cookie", and the value of the header should be the
// value of the cookie from its local cookie database. 
// 
// In this way, the server can take some data that is meaningful to the
// "session" for the user, and store it in a local store (like a sqlite3
// database), and then instruct the browser to keep the *id* of that session
// record in it's local cookie store, and send that id when it sends another
// request. The UI/client-side developer doesn't have to do anything... the
// browser has all of this logic built into it. Handling the set-cookie headers
// (on responses from servers) and the cookie headers (on requests sent to
// servers) is part of a standard for managing cookies, and nearly every browser
// supports these headers according to the standard. 
//

const session = require('express-session');
// connect-session-knex exports a function. This function takes an
// express-session object as a parameter, and returns a class constructor
// function (which you can use with the "new" keyword, as we do below in the
// sessionOptions object.) When you use this method to create a new object, you
// pass it a JSON object comprised configuration properties that tell it where
// to find our knex config file, and what table and column name to create in our
// database, in order to store session records. The object returned by this
// class function has properties and methods that allow express-session to store
// session data through it.

// The session object is a function that returns a middleware method. By calling
// it, and passing our sessionOptions object to it, it creates and returns a
// function that complies with Express middleware criteria (i.e. takes the req,
// res, and next parameters, and can either call next(), or end the chain by a
// call to res.json(), res.send(), res.end(), etc.)
//
// You might remember from your React sessions that a function that returns
// another function is considered a "higher order function". By that definition,
// session() is a higher order function - it returns a middleware function.
// (Also, higher order functions take functions as parameters - so by that
// definition, server.use() is also a higher order function. :) Just sayin'...)
//
// By server.use()'ing the middleware function output of session() here, without
// a METHOD or url, we ensure that it is called for *every* request.
//
// This middleware will basically manage cookie processing and sending, and
// related session data in the store. For every request received (because we
// didn't specify a METHOD, or a url/path), this middleware will search for
// "cookie" headers. The values of any cookie headers included in the request by
// the browser are used to search the store for a record with a "session id"
// (sid) equal to the cookie value. Note that the browser doesn't *invent* the
// cookie value... it first received it from the server. See the "Authentication
// Workflow for sessions" section in the TK:
//
//     https://learn.lambdaschool.com/web4node/module/recvIPgHwxF194c7q/ 
//
//     * Client sends credentials
//     * Server verifies credentials
//     * Server creates a session for the client [and stores it in the store]
//     * Server produces and sends back a cookie [containing the "id" of the 
//       stored session information; with express-session, this "id" is 
//       encrypted using a symmetric cipher - this ensures that when the browser
//       sends the value back, the server can *decrypt* it, and see the actual
//       session id... hash's won't work here, because they are one-way - you 
//       can't "dehash" or "unhash" a hash value to get the original value.]
//     * Client [browser] stores the cookie [either in its memory, if it is a
//       "session" cookie - see the Wikipedia article for a definition of this -
//       or in a "cookie database", usually on disk, if it is a "persistent" 
//       cookie. NOTE: Don't be fooled by the term "session" cookie... this 
//       doesn't mean "a cookie that contains session data or session identifier
//       data". Rather, it means "a cookie that is only in memory for this
//       browser session" - when the browser is shut down, the cookie disappears
//       from the browser's memory. In our example here, we are adding a 
//       "max-age" property to the cookie, which signals to the browser that it
//       is a "persistent" cookie, not a "session" cookie, even though the data
//       that it contains is actually a session id. The browser doesn't know or
//       care what is in the cookie. So to the browser, a "session" cookie is 
//       just a cookie that is only good until the "browser session" ends, when
//       the browser is closed.]
//     * Client [browser] sends cookie [back to the server] on every request 
//       [where the request is to the same domain and path that is stored with 
//       the cookie. This is automatic - the "client software" running on the
//       browser doesn't have to add the cookie as a header... the browser 
//       itself will do it automatically. It's part of the "cookie spec".]
//     * Server verifies that the cookie is valid [ - this is handled 
//       automatically by the express-session middleware that we added to our
//       Express middleware chain by our server.use() below. It searches the 
//       store - configured in sessionOptions (we are using connect-session-knex)
//       - for a record with a session id that matches the cookie value.]
//     * Server provides access to resource [ - the entire value of the session
//       record in the store is added to the req object by the express-session 
//       middleware, if 1) the session ID is valid, and 2) the session hasn't
//       expired - the expiration timeout is a setting in sessionOptions.] 
//
// Whether or not the session ID is valid, this middleware method will create an
// object on req called "session". It's just an object that contains info about
// the cookie that came from the browser, or default values from sessionOptions
// if there is no matching session (or no cookie). If there is a matching
// session record in the store, express-session will add the actual cookie data,
// as well as any other data that was added by us (our code) to the session
// before (in a previous request handling). See the /login handler to see how we
// add something to req.session so that our restricted() middleware can tell if
// the request came with a valid cookie. /login tries to validate the username
// and password, using bcrypt, and if they are valid, the username is added to
// the req.session object. This does 2 things: 1) it makes req.session.username
// available to every other middleware method that will process the request, and
// 2) it makes express-session save the data that we added (the username, in
// this case) to the session data in the store. Any modification to req.session
// is duplicated in the session record in the store. That way, when another
// request comes in from the browser with a cookie that has that same session
// ID, express-session will retrieve the session record, including our custom
// data, and middleware processing the request will see that the request came in
// with a valid cookie (otherwise, the req.session object would be vanilla - it
// wouldn't include the custom data we added before.) Note also that
// express-session will take care of cleaning out our session table in the
// store. When sessions expire, they are automatically removed. So if a browser
// sends a request with a cookie that has the session ID of a session that is
// expired, the session won't be found. (That should never happen though,
// because the session expiration timeout is the same as the cookie expiration
// timeout, and the browser also takes care of removing expired persistent
// cookies from its cookie store - usually.)
//----------------------------------------------------------------------------//
server.use(session(sessionConfig));

// here is where we apply the "restricted" middleware ... the /api/users router
// is protected by the "restricted" middleware function. The restricted function
// checks to see if req.session has a "user" object. It will if : 1) the session
// object is not expired, and 2) the session object was modified by the /login
// handler, by adding a "user" property to it. 
// 
// The session object is kept in express-session's "store" (in memory by
// default.) When a request comes in, express-session looks for a cookie that
// matches the cookie config in the session config object. If it finds one, it
// decrypts the cookie value, and uses the value as an identifier for the
// session object that was created before. If it is a valid session ID, the
// session object is retrieved from the store, and added to the req object. 
// 
// If we ever modify the req.session object, the new session object with our
// modifications is saved back to the store, and the session ID is sent as an
// encrypted cookie (using the settings we set up). 
// 
// If that ID is returned in a request, the corresponding session object, WITH
// OUR MODIFICATIONS which were saved along with it (such as the "user" object
// we add in the /login handler), is saved to the req.session property. 
// 
// This is how the restricted middleware has access to it... the modified
// session object is added to the req object, if the incoming request has a
// valid session ID in the right cookie.
